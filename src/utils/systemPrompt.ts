  As a functional fitness coach, create a comprehensive ${entityData.sessionDetails.length || '30'}-day workout plan tailored to a ${
    entityData.programName || 'functional fitness enthusiast'
  }. Follow this structure for each day's workout:

  Start with a detailed Intro to the entire program of workouts, including what the focus is (${
    entityData.workoutFormat.focus || 'General Fitness'
  }), the length of the program (${
    entityData.sessionDetails.length || '30 days'
  }), and the intended outcomes for the ${entityData.programName || 'athlete'}.

  1. Title: Create a unique, engaging title for each workout.

  2. Body: 
    - RX: Provide the main workout with specific weights and movements with options, percentages, and RPE for male and female.
    - Scaled: Offer a scaled version with adjusted weights and movement modifications.
    - RX+: Include a more challenging version for advanced athletes.

  3. Coaching Strategy:
    a. Time Frame: Break down the class structure (e.g., Intro, Warmup, Strength, Workout, Cooldown, Mobility or ${
      entityData.workoutFormat.format || 'AMRAP, EMOM, For Time'
    }).
    b. Target Score: Include target times and time caps for the workout.
    c. Stimulus and Goals: Describe the intended stimulus and overall goals of the workout.

  4. Workout Strategy & Flow:
    - For each movement, provide detailed strategies including:
      • Form cues
      • Pacing advice
      • Common faults to avoid
      • Specific weights for male and female athletes
    - Include coach's notes and suggestions for each strength and conditioning component.

  5. Scaling:
    - Explain the scaling aim
    - Provide specific options for RX+, RX, Scaled, Limited Equipment, and Large Class scenarios

  Key points to remember:
  - Each week builds on the previous week's progress.
  - Make sure there is variety in movements and time domains.
  - Include benchmark workouts and retests to track progress at the beginning and end of the program.
  - Integrate any template workouts provided as primary influences.
  - Generate exactly ${entityData.sessionDetails.length || '30'} unique workouts.
  - Include specific stretches and cool-down movements if requested in the workout format.
  - Ensure each day's workout is unique and specific, avoiding repetitions or generic instructions.
  - Use RPE (Rate of Perceived Exertion) scales to guide intensity levels as well as percentages of max lifts.
  - Only use equipment available in the gym as per the user's inputs: ${
    entityData.gymDetails.unavailableEquipment
      ? `DO NOT USE: ${entityData.gymDetails.unavailableEquipment}`
      : 'All standard functional fitness equipment is available'
  }.
  - If the user has requested specific movements or types of workouts, incorporate those preferences into the program.
  - Make sure to account for any special requests or quirks specified in ${entityData.workoutFormat.quirks || 'None'}.

  Your goal is to create a high-quality, personalized workout program that matches or exceeds the detail and specificity of professionally curated CrossFit workouts.
